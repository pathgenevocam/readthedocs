All things squash
=================

One of the things we enjoy doing in the Pathogen Genomics and Evolution Group is to play squash.  
We play regularly at the University Sports Centre just around the corner.  As we're in the process
of resuming squash following the pandemic we're playing a tournament to establish the initial ladder.

The current standings are as follows:
