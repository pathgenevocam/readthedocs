Monthly dinners
===============

Global pandemic permitting, once a month the Parkhill group arranges a dinner where we sample a different regional cuisine.
We extend invitations to members of the BIGS lab and DDU and the general idea behind the dinners is to sample a different 
global cuisine each month as well as provide an opportunity for members of the various groups to interact with each other 
in a relaxed, social setting with (normally) excellent food.  To date, by our count, weâ€™ve sampled 14 different cuisines ranging 
from Indian and Chinese to the more exotic such as West African and Polish.  The list of the cuisines and restaurants we've tried
is as follows:
