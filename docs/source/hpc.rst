Using the Cambridge HPC
=======================

The `Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) <https://www.csd3.cam.ac.uk>`_ is one of the `EPSRC <http://www.epsrc.ac.uk>`_
Tier2 National HPC Services hosted by the `Research Computing Services at the University of Cambridge <https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk>`_.  

It is the main computational resource for members of the Pathogen Genomics and Evolution Group.  This page will outline the basics
of accessing and using the HPC but is not meant to be a comprehensive resource.  For more detailed information, the 
`Cambridge HPC page <https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/hpc/index.html>`_ is the place to go.
